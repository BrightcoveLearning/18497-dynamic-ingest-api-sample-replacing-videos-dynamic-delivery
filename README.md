# 18497-dynamic-ingest-api-sample-replacing-videos-dynamic-delivery
In this sample, you will learn how to replace videos using the Dynamic Ingest API. Note that the API does not support operations on multiple videos - the code here simply loops over a data set to replace the videos one by one.  Note that this sample is for accounts using the Dynamic Delivery system. If your account uses the legacy ingest system, see the legacy ingest version instead.
